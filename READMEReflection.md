Essential Questions Reflection
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is a crucial aspect of software development. In my projects, I begin by engaging with stakeholders to gather requirements and insights. Creating "user stories" has been instrumental in this process. These stories encapsulate user perspectives, needs, and potential interactions with the system. By breaking down features into user stories, I ensure a user-centric approach throughout the development lifecycle. This not only aids in better understanding user requirements but also provides a framework for implementation, testing, and validation.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is rooted in agile methodologies, particularly Scrum. I believe in iterative development cycles that prioritize delivering a minimum viable product quickly and then iterating based on feedback. In my future development work, I aim to incorporate agile processes such as regular sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. Continuous integration and delivery will also play a vital role in ensuring a streamlined and efficient development pipeline. These agile practices contribute not only to project success but also to fostering a collaborative and adaptive development environment.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development extends beyond technical skills. Effective communication, collaboration, and adaptability are key attributes. I actively contribute to team discussions, share insights, and listen to diverse perspectives. Timely and transparent communication helps in avoiding misunderstandings and ensures everyone is aligned toward common goals. Additionally, I appreciate the value of feedback and constructive criticism in fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Being reliable, open to learning, and supportive of team members are qualities I prioritize to contribute positively to the team dynamics.
